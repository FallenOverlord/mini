# Searching Algorithms

In this course we are introduced to two searching algorithms, linear search and bineary search.
Linear search is the brute force way of searching. It is time consuming and does not generally appear on tests.
Binary search takes advantage of the order of the list, i.e. the numbers in a list is in ascending or decending order.  
To make a list of number in ascending order we use a technique called Sorting.

## Sorting

You have a randmly ordered list a[5] = {3, 1, 2, 8, 6}.
How do you turn the elements in the list into an ascending order {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}?
Does your algorithm works with all lists?
