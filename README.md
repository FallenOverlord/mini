About This Book

Welcome! I’m Miles Wang, and I built this book to provide accessible, step-by-step guidance for those interested in the exciting world of computer security. My goal is to share everything I’ve learned in the field of cybersecurity, as well as related areas, to contribute back to the community that has helped me grow.

My journey into cybersecurity began with a moment of curiosity back in middle school. While playing a racing game called "Clash of Cars" on my phone, I discovered that if I placed <a></a> around my nickname, it displayed in bright red during matches, while my opponents had dull white names. This small, amusing discovery sparked something bigger: I wanted to understand the mechanisms behind it. Eventually, I learned that the input field in the game didn’t filter special characters, which could be exploited as a serious vulnerability—similar to how malicious hackers perform SQL injections.

From that moment, my interest in cybersecurity only grew. Driven by a desire to protect and improve security, I’ve spent the past two years dedicating at least half an hour each day to mastering the basics of cybersecurity, with a special focus on penetration testing. I’ve also participated in numerous hackathons and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, allowing me to learn from and network with professionals in the field.

I hope my passion and dedication, combined with this book, will help others embark on their own journeys in cybersecurity and contribute positively to society.
