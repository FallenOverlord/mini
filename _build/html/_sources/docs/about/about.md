Hello World! I'm a software developer with a focus on computer security. Currently, I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto.

I've always been passionate about understanding the underlying mechanisms of computer systems as well as applying my knowledge to make software more secure and trustworthy. I strive to build computer systems that are secure and robust.

My expertise includes Java, C, C++, Python and Shell Script. Recently, I have been intrigued with SIEM and penetration testing tools. Aside from coding, I enjoy running, playing board games and the ocarina.
